# CODE EXCEPTIONS - FILES MODULE

This file documents legitimate code patterns that might appear problematic but are actually necessary for the module's functionality.

## 1. Large File Sizes (Monitoring Required)

### Git Operations Handler
**Location:** `backend/mcp/filesys/tools/git_handlers.py` - 728 lines

**Justification:**
Comprehensive git operations require extensive functionality. The file is well-organized with clear separation of concerns for different git commands (clone, pull, push, commit, branch, etc.).

### File System Operations Handler  
**Location:** `backend/mcp/filesys/tools/handlers.py` - 581 lines

**Justification:**
Core file system operations handler that provides all file manipulation capabilities. Breaking it down would create unnecessary complexity and reduce code clarity.

## 2. Import Order Requirements

### Path Setup Required
**Location:** `backend/mcp/filesys/server.py:14-18`

**Justification:**
Must modify `sys.path` BEFORE importing local modules to ensure correct module resolution.

### Pattern:

```python
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent))  # Must come first
from services.mcp.filesys import FileSystemServer  # Now safe to import
```

## 3. Type Ignores for Handler Execution

### Dynamic Handler Invocation
**Location:** `backend/mcp/filesys/tools/executor.py:87,94,95`

**Justification:**
Handler functions are dynamically resolved and invoked based on tool names. Type checking cannot statically verify these dynamic calls.

### Argument Type Mismatches
**Location:** `backend/mcp/filesys/tools/definitions.py:335`

**Justification:**
MCP protocol requires specific argument structures that don't always match Python's type hints exactly.

## Summary

All critical issues have been resolved in this module:
- Deleted obsolete localfs directory (1000+ lines of problematic code)
- Fixed ALL broad exception handlers with specific types
- All tests passing (62 passed, 1 skipped)

The remaining items are acceptable patterns or soft limits that should be monitored but don't require immediate action.
